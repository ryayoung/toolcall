# OpenAI Functions

```
pip install toolcall
```

The most natural way to implement functions for OpenAI tool calling.

`@openai_function`:
- **Argument validation of complex types** using Pydantic `BaseModel` under the hood.
- **Automatic JSON Schema creation** using a mix of docstring parsing, Pydantic's `model_json_schema()`, and custom enhancements.
- **Utility methods for raw tool-call processing**

```py
from toolcall import openai_function
from typing import Literal
import json

@openai_function
def get_stock_price(ticker: str, currency: Literal["USD", "EUR"] = "USD"):
    """
    Get the stock price of a company, by ticker symbol

    Parameters
    ----------
    ticker
        The ticker symbol of the company
    currency
        The currency to use
    """
    return f"182.41 {currency}, -0.48 (0.26%) today"


get_stock_price
```
```json
OpenaiFunction({
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "get_stock_price",
        "description": "Get the stock price of a company, by ticker symbol",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "ticker": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The ticker symbol of the company"
                },
                "currency": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The currency to use",
                    "enum": [
                        "USD",
                        "EUR"
                    ],
                    "default": "USD"
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "ticker"
            ]
        }
    }
})
```

Everything you need for implementing function calling is encapsulated in a single object.

## How does it work?

`@openai_function`:
1. Turns your function into a subclass of `pydantic.BaseModel` with your function's parameters as attributes. So, in the example above, running `get_stock_price(ticker="AAPL")` would create an instance of this model, validating the arguments.
2. Creates the JSON schema shown above, and stores it as a class attribute
3. Implements a `.execute()` instance method that passes the instance's attributes to the function you defined.
4. Implements `.run_tool_call()` and `.run_function_call()` class methods that process a raw tool/function call from OpenAI end-to-end, producing a tool message as the result, to send back to OpenAI


## Getting Started

#### Get OpenAI function definition schema
```py
get_stock_price.schema
```
```
{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'get_stock_price', 'description': 'Get the stock price of a company, by ticker symbol', 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'ticker': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The ticker symbol of the company'}, 'currency': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The currency to use', 'enum': ['USD', 'EUR'], 'default': 'USD'}}, 'required': ['ticker']}}}
```

#### Instantiate our pydantic model, validating arguments

```py
validated_function_call = get_stock_price(ticker="AAPL")
```

#### Execute the function, with already-validated arguments
```py
validated_function_call.execute()
```
```
'182.41 USD, -0.48 (0.26%) today'
```

## End-to-End Tool Call Processing, with Error Handling

When an OpenAI model chooses to call the `get_stock_price` function we defined, it sends us a message like this.
```py
message_from_openai = {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": None,
    "tool_calls": [
        {
            "type": "function",
            "id": "call_LD0WokrRan5j8B5UehILAdMq",
            "function": {
                "name": "get_stock_price",
                "arguments": "{\"ticker\": \"AAPL\"}"
            },
        }
    ]
}

tool_call = message_from_openai["tool_calls"][0]
```

Our `get_stock_price` has a utility classmethod, `run_tool_call`, to handle this elegantly.

```py
tool_response_message = get_stock_price.run_tool_call(tool_call)
tool_response_message
```
```
{
    'role': 'tool',
    'tool_call_id': 'call_LD0WokrRan5j8B5UehILAdMq',
    'content': '182.41 USD, -0.48 (0.26%) today'
}
```

This method handles all the boilerplate for you:
- Keeping track of the tool call `id`
- Parsing JSON
- Passing arguments to your function model for Pydantic validation
- Executing your function with the validated arguments
- Wrapping the result in a response message

### It also makes error handling easy

The `run_tool_call()` method accepts an `error_handler` argument: a callback function that takes an exception and returns a string to send back to OpenAI, documenting the error.

Pass `error_handler=True` to use the default handler.

Consider this example, where we receive incorrect types:

```py
bad_tool_call = {
    "type": "function",
    "id": "call_LD0WokrRan5j8B5UehILAdMq",
    "function": {
        "name": "get_stock_price",
        "arguments": "{\"ticker\": 5, \"currency\": \"FOOBAR\"}"
    },
}

tool_response_message = get_stock_price.run_tool_call(bad_tool_call, error_handler=True)
tool_response_message
```
```
{
   'role': 'tool',
   'tool_call_id': 'call_LD0WokrRan5j8B5UehILAdMq',
   'content': 
      'Validation failed for the following parameters

      ticker:
        Input: 5
        Error: Input should be a valid string

      currency:
        Input: 'FOOBAR'
        Error: Input should be 'USD' or 'EUR'
      ',
}
```

# Tool Groups

```py
def get_stock_price(ticker: str):
    "Get the stock price of a company, by ticker symbol."
    return "182.41 USD, âˆ’0.48 (0.26%) today"

def get_weather(city: str):
    "Get the current weather in a city."
    return "Sunny and 75 degrees"

def get_current_datetime(city: str):
    "Get the current date and time in a city."
    return "Friday, Nov. 10, 2023, 10:00 AM"

group = openai_tool_group([get_stock_price, get_weather, get_current_datetime])
group
```
```
OpenaiToolGroup([
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "get_stock_price",
            "description": "Get the stock price of a company, by ticker symbol.",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "ticker": {
                        "type": "string"

                    }
                },
                "required": [
                    "city"
                ]
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "get_current_datetime",
            "description": "Get the current date and time in a city.",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "city": {
                        "type": "string"
                    }
                },
                "required": [
                    "city"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
])
```


> Note: Use `group.tools` to get a list of the raw tool schemas to use in the `tools` argument to OpenAI. Or `group.functions` to get only the functions, for the deprecated function calling API.

#### Now, when we get a function tool call from OpenAI, the group can handle it.
```py
tool_call = {
    "type": "function",
    "id": "call_LD0WokrRan5j8B5UehILAdMq",
    "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "arguments": "{\"city\": \"Denver\"}",
    },
}

tool_response_message = group.run_tool_call(tool_call, error_handler=True)
tool_response_message
```
```
{
    'role': 'tool',
    'tool_call_id': 'call_LD0WokrRan5j8B5UehILAdMq',
    'content': 'Sunny and 75 degrees'
}
```

# Create your own ChatGPT, with automated tool call handling

## Step 1. Conversation handler

```py
import os
import json
from toolcall import openai_tool_group, openai_function, OpenaiToolGroup
from dataclasses import dataclass
from openai import OpenAI
from openai.types.chat.chat_completion import Choice
from typing import Optional


@dataclass
class ChatGPTConversation:
    model: str
    client: OpenAI
    tool_group: OpenaiToolGroup
    messages: list[dict]

    def chat(self):
        result = self.get_openai_response()
        self.add_message(result.message.model_dump(exclude_unset=True))

        if result.message.tool_calls:
            for call in result.message.tool_calls:
                result_msg = self.tool_group.run_tool_call(call, error_handler=True)
                self.add_message(result_msg)

        if result.finish_reason == 'tool_calls':
            self.chat()

    def get_openai_response(self) -> Choice:
        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            messages=self.messages,
            model=self.model,
            tools=self.tool_group.tools,
        )
        return response.choices[0]

    def add_message(self, message: dict):
        print(json.dumps(message, indent=4))
        self.messages.append(message)

    def send_message(self, prompt: str):
        self.add_message({"role": "user", "content": prompt})
        self.chat()
```

> Here, `chat()` is a recursive method that continues sending API requests
for as long as the response's `finish_reason='function_call'`.

## Step 2. Create a new conversation
```py
chatgpt = ChatGPTConversation(
    model="gpt-4-1106-preview",
    client=OpenAI(api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]),
    tool_group=group, # using the group defined earlier
    messages=[
        dict(role="system", content="You are a helpful AI assistant."),
    ]
)
```

## Step 4. Exchange messages

**You'll need to use Jupyter notebooks (or interactive terminal) for this**

```py
chatgpt.send_message("Hello, how are you?")
```
```
{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Hello, how are you?"
}
{
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Hello! I'm just a computer program, so I don't have feelings, but I'm ready and functioning properly. How can I assist you today?"
}
```

```py
chatgpt.send_message(
    "I'm enjoying my breakfast here in Denver. Can you list 3 fun "
    "things to do here, then give me a quick morning update?"
)
```
```
{
    "role": "user",

}
{
    "role": "assistant",

#### If we stitch together the `content` of each *assistant* message (2nd and last messages), we get a continuous block of response text:

> Sure, Denver offers many activities for a fun day out. Here are three fun things to do in Denver:
> 
> 1. **Visit the Denver Art Museum**: Recognized for its collection of American Indian Art and its impressive array of modern and contemporary pieces, the Denver Art Museum is a great place to get a dose of culture. The building itself is an architectural work of art.

The response text above combines the content from API responses **2** and **4**.


# Function Calling API

**_(Deprecated by OpenAI)_**

`openai_function` and `OpenaiToolGroup` also support the deprecated function-calling API. 

- The function schema is accessible by `schema["function"]`, which can be passed inside a list to the `functions` argument in your OpenAI request. In an `OpenaiToolGroup`, this list is quickly accessible via the `functions` property.
- Use `.run_function_call()` instead of `.run_tool_call()`, to process results.

Example:

```py
message_from_openai = {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": None,
    "function_call": {
        "name": "get_stock_price",
        "arguments": "{\"ticker\": \"AAPL\"}",
    },
}
function_call = message_from_openai["function_call"]
```

Use `run_function_call()`

```py
function_response_message = get_stock_price.run_function_call(function_call)
function_response_message
```
```
{
    'role': 'function',
    'name': 'get_stock_price',
    'content': '182.41 USD, -0.48 (0.26%) today'
}
```

## Create your own ChatGPT (function calling version)

### Conversation handler

```py
# subclassing our previous version

class ChatGPTFunctionConversation(ChatGPTConversation):

    def get_openai_response(self) -> Choice:
        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            messages=self.messages,
            model=self.model,
            functions=self.tool_group.functions,  # Pass `functions` instead of `tools`
        )
        return response.choices[0]

    def chat(self):
        result = self.get_openai_response()
        self.add_message(result.message.model_dump(exclude_unset=True))

        # Handling just one function call, rather than a list of tool calls.
        func_call = result.message.function_call
        if func_call:
            result_msg = self.tool_group.run_function_call(func_call, error_handler=True)
            self.add_message(result_msg)
